# Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
# The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target,
# where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2)
# are not zeroÂ­based.
#
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
#
# Input: numbers={2, 7, 11, 15}, target=9
#
# Output: index1=1, index2=2

#Solution1:
#Complexity n^2
